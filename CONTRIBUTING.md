# Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to the project, I _welcome_ it; however, there are a few rules that
I'd like all contributors and developers (including myself) to follow.

1. Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tommcfarlin/simple-autoloader-for-wordpress/issues) to report any problems that you have.
    * Be specific...
        * Explain your problem,
        * Provide precise steps for how to reproduce it.
        
2. If you have a change you'd like to introduce:
    1. Create a new branch,
    2. Make your changes,
    3. Explain the **what** _and_ the **why**,
    4. Open a pull request.
    
`master` should _always_ incude the tagged, stable branch. I like to work off of `develop`. Once changes are merged
into `develop` and are stable, I'll merge them into `master` and tag them.

### Expectations, Please
    
Note that I try to pay attention to _all_ issues and PRs but this _is_ a hobby project so it's prioritized
appropriately.

I've learned that if I don't disclaim this from the outset, there are unreasonable expectations.

### Other Information

* I'm happy to give credit when credit is due so when more developers contribute, I'll be adding a new file to this 
repository.

* You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tommcfarlin) at almost anytime. I don't really use it for 
 support, but sharing the project or related posts is _always_ welcome.
 
* Thanks in advance for anything and everything you opt to offer to the project!
